## What is Unbound

> _Unbound is a validating, recursive, caching DNS resolver._
> _It is designed to be fast and lean and incorporates modern features based on open standards. 
Late 2019, Unbound has been rigorously audited, which means that the code base is more resilient than ever._

Source: [unbound.net](https://unbound.net/)

## About this Image

This container image is based on Alpine Linux with focus on security, performance and a small image size.
The unbound process runs in the context of a non-root user, is sealed with chroot and makes use of unprivileged ports (5335 tcp/udp).

Unbound is configured as an DNSSEC validating DNS resolver, which directly queries DNS root servers utilizing zone transfers holding a local copy of the root zone (see [IETF RFC 8806](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8806.txt)) to build a "hyperlocal" setup as an upstream DNS server in combination with [Pi-hole](https://pi-hole.net/) for adblocking in mind, but works also as a standalone server. However, even though the image is intended to run a "hyperlocal" setup, it does not necessarily mean that it has to be used that way. You are absolutely free to edit the [unbound.conf](https://www.nlnetlabs.nl/documentation/unbound/unbound.conf/) file according to your own needs and requirements, especially if you'd rather like to use an upstream DNS server which provides DoT or DoH features instead of using the "hyperlocal" feature.
       
To provide always the latest versions, the following software components are self compiled in the build process using separated workflows and are not just installed:
    
- [`Unbound`](https://github.com/madnuttah/unbound-docker/actions/workflows/build-unbound.yaml)
- [`Libevent`](https://github.com/madnuttah/unbound-docker/actions/workflows/build-libevent-buildenv.yaml)
- [`OpenSSL`](https://github.com/madnuttah/unbound-docker/actions/workflows/build-openssl-buildenv.yaml)
    
**The image is completely built online via a [GitHub Action](https://github.com/features/actions) with [hardened runners](https://github.com/step-security/harden-runner) and _not_ locally on my systems. All components as well as the Internic files (root.hints and root.zone) are verified with their corresponding PGP keys and signature files if available to guarantee maximum security and trust.**

**Unbound itself is compiled from source with hardening security features such as [PIE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Position-independent_code) (Position Independent Executables), which randomizes the application's position in memory which makes attacks more difficult and [RELRO](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/hardening-elf-binaries-using-relocation-read-only-relro) (Relocation Read-Only) which also can mitigate exploitations by preventing memory corruption.**

I hope you enjoy the image. 
    
## Installation

Current multiarch-builds of the image are available on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/madnuttah/unbound) and is the recommended source of installation on any Linux-based 386, arm, arm64 or amd64 platform.

## How to use this Image

You should adapt the [`/usr/local/unbound/unbound.conf`](https://github.com/madnuttah/unbound-docker/blob/main/unbound/root/usr/local/unbound/unbound.conf) file and my example [`docker-compose.yaml`](https://github.com/madnuttah/unbound-docker/tree/main/unbound/examples) files to your needs. The compose files also deploys [Pi-hole](https://pi-hole.net/) for blocking ads and to prevent tracking as well as [Watchtower](https://containrrr.dev/watchtower/) for keeping your images up to date. 

To provide a better structuring of the unbound.conf file, directories for **optionally** storing zone and other configuration files as well as for your certificates and the unbound.log file have been created and can be mounted as volumes: 
    
- [`/usr/local/unbound/certs.d/`](https://github.com/madnuttah/unbound-docker/tree/main/unbound/examples/usr/local/unbound/certs.d/) for storing your certificate files.

- [`/usr/local/unbound/conf.d/`](https://github.com/madnuttah/unbound-docker/tree/main/unbound/examples/usr/local/unbound/conf.d/) for your configuration files like interfaces.conf, performance.conf, security.conf, etc.
    
- [`/usr/local/unbound/log.d/unbound.log`](https://github.com/madnuttah/unbound-docker/tree/main/unbound/examples/usr/local/unbound/log.d/unbound.log) in case you need to access it for troubleshooting and debugging purposes.

- [`/usr/local/unbound/zones.d/`](https://github.com/madnuttah/unbound-docker/tree/main/unbound/examples/usr/local/unbound/zones.d/) for your zone configuration files like auth-zone.conf, stub-zone.conf, forward-zone.conf, etc.
    
**The config files in the `conf.d` and `zones.d` folders must be named with the suffix .conf to prevent issues with specific host configurations.**
    
The splitted configuration files located in [`unbound/examples/usr/local/unbound`](https://github.com/madnuttah/unbound-docker/tree/main/unbound/examples/usr/local/unbound) are only meant to give you an impression on how to separating and structuring the configs. Please mind that those files are **examples** which also needs to be edited to make them work for your environment if you intend to use them. It might be necessary to fix permissions and ownership of the files put in the persistent volumes if unbound refuses to start. You can access the _running_ image by executing the following command in your shell: `sudo docker exec -ti madnuttah-unbound /bin/sh`. If you have assigned a different name for the image than `madnuttah-unbound`, this must be adjusted of course.

Other than that, splitting ain't really necessary as your standard unbound.conf will perfectly do the job.

### Networking

| Port      | Description              |
| --------- | ------------------------ |
| `5335`    | Listening Port (TCP/UDP) |

If you want to use this image as a standalone DNS resolver _without_ Pi-hole, the given ports must be changed to `53` (TCP/UDP) in your unbound.conf and docker-compose.yaml.

### Standard Usage

The best way to get started is using [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/). I have provided combined Pi-hole/Unbound/Watchtower [`docker-compose.yaml`](https://github.com/madnuttah/unbound-docker/blob/main/unbound/examples/) samples which I'm using in slightly modified form that makes use of a [MACVLAN](https://docs.docker.com/network/macvlan/) or [Bridge](https://docs.docker.com/network/bridge/) network which **must** be adapted to your network environment and to suit your needs for development or production use. **Especially all entries in angle brackets (<>) needs your very attention!** 

*I prefer using a MACVLAN network configuration instead of a bridged or rather unsafe host network, but other network configurations will run as well.*

Anyway, you can also spin up the container with the following command:

```console
docker run --name madnuttah-unbound -d \
-p 5335:5335/udp \
-p 5335:5335/tcp \
--restart=unless-stopped \
madnuttah/unbound:latest
```
